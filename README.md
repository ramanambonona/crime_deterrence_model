# Optimal law enforcement with python
Optimal Law Enforcement with python (deterrence model)\
This project is designed to find the optimal sanction and the optimal probability of arrest in Nuno Garoupa's (2001) optimal law enforcement model. I use python code to find the optimal points (\math $S^*$, and $p^*$).

In order to run the program, the user is asked to install :
# 1. install
python 3.6 (or higher)
pip install sympy
pip install matplotlib
pip install jupyter notebook

then write in the command :
pip install -m notebook

# 2. Download the files

You are invited to download the file : "standard_deterr.ipynb" in the model directory

Write in your browser (chrome for example) : http://localhost:8888/
then, you can search in your download directories (desktop local file) the file "standard_deterr.ipynb".

Once you have found the file, you can launch each code step by step in Jupyter notebook.
