# Optimal law enforcement with python
Optimal Law Enforcement with python (deterrence model)\
This project is designed to find the optimal sanction and the optimal probability of arrest and punishment in Nuno Garoupa's (2001) optimal law enforcement model. I use python code to find the optimal points ($S$, and $p$).

In order to run the program, the user is asked to follow the instruction below
# 1. Installation required
python 3.6 (or higher)\
pip install sympy\
pip install matplotlib\
pip install jupyter notebook

then write in the command :
python -m notebook

# 2. Download file

You are invited to download the file : "deterr_model.ipynb" 

Write in your browser (chrome for example) : http://localhost:8888/
then, you can search in your download directories (desktop local file) the file "deterr_model.ipynb".

Once you have found the file, you can launch each code step by step in Jupyter notebook.
